        <h3>Little bit about Spanish history</h3> 
        Spain, officially the Kingdom of Spain (Spanish: Reino de España), is a sovereign state largely located on the Iberian
        Peninsula in southwestern Europe, with archipelagos in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea, and several small
        territories on and near the North African coast. Its Mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean
        Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar; to the north and northeast by France, Andorra, and the Bay of
        Biscay; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. 
        
        Spanish territory includes two archipelagos: the Balearic Islands, in the Mediterranean Sea, and the Canary Islands, in the Atlantic Ocean off the African coast.
        It also includes two major exclaves, Ceuta and Melilla, in continental North Africa; and the islands and peñones
        (rocks) of Alborán, Alhucemas, Chafarinas and Vélez de la Gomera. With an area of 505,990 km2 (195,360 sq mi), Spain
        is the largest country in Southern Europe, the second largest country in Western Europe and the European Union, and
        the fourth largest country in the European continent. By population, Spain is the sixth largest in Europe and the
        fifth in the European Union, after Italy. Spain's capital and largest city is Madrid, other major urban areas include
        Barcelona, Valencia, Seville, Bilbao and Málaga.
